Redmine CMDB plugin
===================

This plugin helps you connect your CMDB to Redmine, so that you can link tickets with your CI. It works by keeping a mirror table of your assets in Redmine's database, so that it's CMDB-agnostic, but you'll have to do a (tiny) script to keep everything in sync.
